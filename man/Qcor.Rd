\title{Quantile Correlation Matrix}
\usage{
Qcor(x, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame (columns represent variables).}

\item{q}{Numeric in \verb{[0, 1]}; the quantile level at which the quantile correlation is evaluated.}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix of dimension \code{ncol(x)} by \code{ncol(x)}:
\itemize{
\item Diagonal elements are equal to 1.
\item Off-diagonal elements are pairwise quantile correlations.
}
}
\description{
Computes the symmetric matrix of pairwise \strong{quantile correlations} at a given quantile level \code{q},
following the quantile correlation coefficient proposed by Choi and Shin (2022).
This allows users to examine dependence between variables at specific quantiles (e.g., lower-tail,
median, or upper-tail dependence) rather than only at the mean.
}
\details{
For two variables \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y}, the quantile correlation at level \eqn{q}
is based on the product of the quantile regression slopes from
\eqn{Y \sim X} and \eqn{X \sim Y} at quantile \eqn{q}.
The sign is taken from the \eqn{Y \sim X} regression slope, and the
result is truncated to keep the correlation within \eqn{[-1, 1]}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(quantreg)
data <- matrix(rnorm(500), ncol = 5)
colnames(data) <- paste0("Var", 1:5)
Qcor(data, q = 0.1)    # lower-tail dependence
Qcor(data, q = 0.5)    # median correlation
Qcor(data, q = 0.9)    # upper-tail dependence
}
