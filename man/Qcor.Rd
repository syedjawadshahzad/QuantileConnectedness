\title{Quantile Correlation Matrix}
\usage{
Qcor(x, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame (columns represent variables).}

\item{q}{Numeric in \verb{[0, 1]}; the quantile level at which the quantile correlation is evaluated.}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix of dimension \verb{ncol(x) × ncol(x)}:
\itemize{
\item Diagonal elements are equal to 1.
\item Off-diagonal elements are pairwise quantile correlations.
}
}
\description{
Computes the symmetric matrix of pairwise \strong{quantile correlations} at a given quantile level \code{q},
following the quantile correlation coefficient proposed by Choi and Shin (2022).
This allows users to examine dependence between variables at specific quantiles (e.g., lower-tail,
median, or upper-tail dependence) rather than only at the mean.
}
\details{
For two variables \(X\) and \(Y\), the quantile correlation at level \(q\)
is based on the product of the quantile regression slopes from
\(Y \sim X\) and \(X \sim Y\) at quantile \(q\).
The sign is taken from the \(Y \sim X\) regression slope, and the
result is truncated to keep the correlation within \eqn{[-1, 1]}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(quantreg)
data <- matrix(rnorm(500), ncol = 5)
colnames(data) <- paste0("Var", 1:5)
Qcor(data, q = 0.1)    # lower-tail dependence
Qcor(data, q = 0.5)    # median correlation
Qcor(data, q = 0.9)    # upper-tail dependence
}
