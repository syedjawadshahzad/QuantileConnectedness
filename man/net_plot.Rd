\usage{
net_plot(
  x,
  Cnames,
  layout = "circle",
  groups = NULL,
  div = 5,
  node.size = 20,
  edge = 3,
  pie.colour = c("red", "yellow")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A square connectedness matrix with the last row/column possibly containing totals.
The function uses the top-left \eqn{p \times p} block where \eqn{p = ncol(x) - 1}.}

\item{Cnames}{Character vector of node labels (length \eqn{p}).}

\item{layout}{Character layout passed to \code{\link[qgraph]{qgraph}}; e.g., \code{"circle"} or \code{"spring"}.
Default \code{"circle"}.}

\item{groups}{Optional vector/list of group memberships for node coloring in \code{qgraph}.}

\item{div}{Positive number controlling edge thresholding; larger values keep fewer edges
(top \eqn{p^2/div}). Default \code{5}.}

\item{node.size}{Base node size multiplier. Default \code{20}.}

\item{edge}{Base edge width (passed to \code{qgraph} as \code{esize} and \code{asize}). Default \code{3}.}

\item{pie.colour}{Length-2 character vector for the pie colors (FROM, TO).
Default \code{c("red","yellow")}.}
}
\value{
A \code{qgraph} object (plot is drawn as a side-effect).
}
\description{
Draws a network graph from a connectedness matrix. Node sizes reflect total connectivity,
and node pies show the share of "FROM" vs "TO" connectivity. Edges are thresholded to keep
the top \eqn{p^2 / \mathrm{div}} strongest links.
}
\details{
The function normalizes the \eqn{p \times p} connectivity matrix by its sum, sets
the diagonal to zero, computes node sizes as the normalized sum of in- and out-going
strengths, and constructs a two-slice pie per node where the first slice is
the "FROM" share and the second is the "TO" share. Edges are retained by
applying a numeric threshold equal to the \eqn{(p^2/\mathrm{div})}-th largest weight.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose 'TAB' is a connectedness TABLE with p+1 rows/cols (last is totals)
# and 'labs' is a character vector of length p:
g <- net_plot(TAB, Cnames = labs, layout = "spring")
}
